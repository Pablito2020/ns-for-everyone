# network simulator 2 (ns-2) for (almost) everyone! ðŸŽ‰
Unfortunately, if you're using an ARM computer that isn't an M1 or M2 Mac capable of emulating an x86 architecture via Docker, this image won't be compatible, sorry ðŸ¤·

## How it works
In [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/) it's very easy to install ns-2, since it has a patched version available on the [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/). This repository simplifies the process by creating a Docker image based on ArchLinux, integrating necessary patches into ns-2, and installing it seamlessly.

## Added patches
I've added patches for showing the Reno agent current time and current timeout, for now it shows the result on stdout.

To add a patch, generate it from a git commit using:

```bash
$ git format-patch -1 <commit SHA>
```

Then, place the patch in the src/ folder and add it inside the PKGBUILD. You'll need to obtain the SHA256 hash of the .patch file, which can be done with:

```bash
$sha256sum <name of patch>
```

## Execute it:
For executing it you can download the image and run a new container:

```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/pablito2020/ns-for-everyone:main
$ docker run -it ghcr.io/pablito2020/ns-for-everyone:main
```
